# 📚 My 80-Day Learning Journey: SQL, Data Analytics & Personal Growth
## Intorduction
Welcome to my personal data journey! Over the course of 80 days, I tracked, analyzed, and visualized my study habits, productivity, distractions, and progress using real data from my daily routine.

This repo documents:
- What I studied
- How I practiced
- What projects I built
- And how I used SQL, Excel, and even AI tools like ChatGPT to reflect, grow, and get better.

## 📖 Project Background

This project started with a simple idea:  
> *"What if I treated my learning journey like a real data project?"*

I was already studying SQL and other tools like Excel for  data analytics, but I wanted to go deeper  to analyze my **own behavior** as a learner.  
So for 80 days, I tracked my daily study routine, distractions, motivation, mood, project work, and more.

### 🔍 Why I Did This
- To understand when and why I study best  
- To learn what derails my consistency  
- To practice SQL with **real, messy data** (my own habits!)  
- To turn self-awareness into insight and insight into better habits

### 🛠️ How I Collected the Data
- Logged daily entries manually in Excel  
- Tracked mood, energy, study hours, distractions, and prayer consistency  
- Tagged every project with tools used, hours spent, and purpose  
- Exported to CSV and analyzed using PostgreSQL + visualization tools

This wasn’t just about data. It was about designing a system that helped me learn better, reflect deeper, and grow faster  using data to hold up a mirror.



## 🧠 Key Insights From My Study Data

### 1. **Study Consistency**
I studied on **47 out of 79** logged days that’s a solid **60% consistency rate**.

| Status       | Days | Percentage |
|--------------|------|------------|
| Studied      | 47   | 59.5%      |
| Not Studied  | 32   | 40.5%      |

> 🎯 **Why I Studied vs. Why I Didn't**  
> That 60% consistency didn’t happen by luck  it was fueled by strong days where I followed my prayer routine, avoided distractions, and studied right after meals.  
> The 40% of missed days often had valid reasons: **exams**, **personal issues**, **long social meals**, or nights where I scrolled or played FIFA too long and burned the next day.  
> Some days I just planned to rest  and that’s part of the journey too.  
> What this chart really shows isn’t just effort, but **balance**. I learned how to bounce back without guilt and how my environment shaped my outcomes.

### 2. **Mood, Energy & Study Quality**
When my energy level was between 7–9, my average study time increased significantly. Mood also had a positive correlation, but energy was the better predictor of productivity.

| Level (1–10) | Avg Study Hours (Mood) | Avg Study Hours (Energy) |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 6            | 1.80                   | 1.75                      |
| 7            | 2.45                   | 2.65                      |
| 8            | 2.90                   | 3.10                      |
| 9            | 2.40                   | 2.80                      |

> 🔋 **What Really Boosted My Study Sessions**  
> Days with mood and energy levels at 7–9 consistently led to longer study sessions especially when I studied right after meals and stayed off my phone.  
> Coffee helped. Not because it magically made me smarter, but because it lifted my energy and mood just enough to get started  and that’s all I needed.  
> Still, I had high-energy days where I didn’t study. Usually those were **socially packed**, or I just didn’t protect my focus.  
> This insight taught me that energy is precious   but if I don’t **channel it**, I lose it. It’s not just about how I feel, it’s about what I do with how I feel.



> ☕ Also notable: On days I drank coffee, mood and energy levels were generally higher   and so were my study hours.

### 3. **Skills That Took Real Effort**
These are based on real study sessions logged before mastery  not just calendar gaps.

| Skill        | Study Days | Date Mastered | Confidence (1–10) |
|--------------|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Subqueries   | 6          | 2025-04-03     | 8                  |
| CTEs         | 2          | 2025-04-07     | 8                  |
| Filtering    | 1          | 2025-03-10     | 9                  |
| JOINs        | 1          | 2025-03-20     | 9                  |


> 🧠 **What Took Effort vs. What Came Easy**  
> Some skills  like **JOINs**  clicked fast. But others, like **Subqueries**, needed more reps.  
> The study days logged here aren’t just about difficulty  they reflect **what I prioritized**. I didn’t rush through subqueries because I wanted to master them deeply.  
> Quick wins like Filtering came from prior intuition and repeated exposure in real projects.  
> This table shows me where I had to slow down and really think  and I’m glad I did. That effort built the kind of confidence you can’t fake.

### 4. **Main Focus Areas by Time Spent**
SQL dominated my time, showing it was my #1 priority to master deeply.

| Main Focus | Total Study Hours |
|------------|--------------------|
| SQL        | 20.5               |
| Projects   | 10.0               |
| Excel      | 8.0                |
| CTEs       | 6.0                |
| Subqueries | 5.5                |



> 📌 **Why I Focused So Much on SQL**  
> The time I spent reflects where I wanted to be strong. SQL wasn’t just another tool  it was the foundation of my entire learning journey.  
> Every project relied on it. Every challenge improved it. That’s why it has the most hours.  
> I balanced that with hands-on practice in Excel and built mini dashboards. Projects weren’t just a break  they were how I *proved* what I learned.  
> This isn’t just a chart of time  it’s a reflection of my priorities. I didn’t aim for balance. I aimed for **impact**.

### 6. **Tools I Used Most in Projects**
I used ChatGPT to unblock problems and accelerate learning in every single project. It’s part of my workflow now.

| Tool     | Projects Used In |
|----------|------------------|
| SQL      | 4                |
| Excel    | 3                |
| ChatGPT  | 3                |

> ⚙️ **How I Turned Tools Into a Workflow**    
> SQL was the backbone: I used it to clean data, extract insights, and build logic.  
> Excel helped me visualize things quickly and build mini dashboards I could actually use.  
> ChatGPT stepped in whenever I hit a wall  whether it was debugging a tricky join or brainstorming the next steps in a project.  
> Together, these tools didn’t just help me finish tasks  they helped me **learn faster**, **solve smarter**, and **create more confidently**.

### 7. **Distraction Impact**
Days that included both FIFA and late scrolling had the lowest average study time — less than 1 hour.

| Distraction Combo              | Avg Study Hours |
|-------------------------------|------------------|
| No FIFA / No Scrolling        | 2.95 hrs         |
| FIFA Only                     | 2.10 hrs         |
| Scrolling Only                | 1.75 hrs         |
| FIFA + Scrolling (Both)       | 0.95 hrs         |

> 🔻 **How Distractions Undermined Progress**  
> This table hit hard. When I played FIFA and scrolled late at night, I rarely studied the next day. The combo didn’t just waste time  it wrecked momentum.  
> But even *one* distraction was enough to shave off study hours. These weren’t lazy days  they were **unprotected** days.  
> I didn’t always notice the pattern until the data laid it bare.  
> Now I know: staying focused isn’t about having willpower it’s about removing friction. This insight helped me build smarter habits, like praying on time, eating alone when I needed to, and cutting FIFA when I was behind.


> 📉 Combining distractions created a compound negative effect on study output.

## 🔧 Challenges I Faced

> 🚧 **Learning wasn't always smooth. Here’s what slowed me down:**

- 🧹 **Messy data**: Real-world datasets weren’t clean. I had to trim spaces, fix inconsistent labels, and deal with unexpected NULLs.
- ⏳ **Date functions**: Calculating durations, mastering `AGE()`, and figuring out how to compare and filter by date values took a lot of trial and error.
- 🧠 **Complex queries**: As analysis got deeper, queries became nested and hard to debug. I had to learn to breathe, slow down, and test in parts.
- 💻 **Joining tables smartly**: One mismatched key or forgotten `TRIM()` caused massive logic gaps  especially in the skill-to-session mappings.

> But overcoming these made me sharper. I didn’t just learn SQL  I learned how to stay patient when things break.

---
## 🧠 General Insights

> ✍️ **Here’s what this journey really taught me:**

- ⚖️ **Consistency is hard**: Not every day is productive, and that’s okay. The goal is rhythm, not perfection.
- 🧗 **Some topics are just harder**: Subqueries, date logic, and CTEs stretched my brain. But deep effort brought real growth.
- 🔥 **Distraction kills momentum**: Even one slip like playing FIFA at night  could derail an entire study streak.
- ☕ **Energy isn’t enough**: I had high-energy days where I still didn’t study. Discipline and routine mattered more.
- 📊 **Data teaches self-awareness**: Tracking myself made me understand myself. That’s the real value here.

## 💬 Reflections

> This wasn’t just about SQL or Excel  this was a habit-building system. I turned learning into data, data into insight, and insight into better focus, deeper thinking, and real projects.
>
> If you're on your own data learning journey, feel free to fork this, remix it, or use the templates to build your own.

## ✅ Final Conclusion

This wasn’t just a study log  it was a **personal transformation record**.  
I didn’t master everything in 80 days, but I built habits, saw my weaknesses, tracked my discipline, and most importantly, proved to myself that I can grow.

Every dataset, every visualization, every SQL query was a mirror  and it helped me become the learner I want to be.
Let’s keep going.
